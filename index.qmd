I am a PhD candidate at NYU Tandon where I am fortunate to be advised 
by [Lisa Hellerstein](https://cse.engineering.nyu.edu/~hstein/) and [Chris Musco](https://www.chrismusco.com/). 
My research is generously supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

My primary research focuses on how deep learning, discrete optimization, and randomized algorithms can help solve problems with social impact. I am also interested in designing algorithms for quantum computers and how to make these algorithms robust to errors.

I received my undergraduate degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science from Middlebury College.
At Middlebury, I designed quantum algorithms for graph theory problems with [Shelby Kimmel](http://shelbykimmel.com/)
and worked on applications of math in recreational board games with [Alex Lyford](https://www.middlebury.edu/academics/math/faculty/node/550503).

I developed code-based tutorials on [adversarial image attacks](https://github.com/rtealwitter/dl-demos/blob/217fb01a7f2c3b15f0d7f72a00235016afbd9c4c/generative/Adversarial%20Image%20Classification.ipynb), [neural style transfer](https://github.com/rtealwitter/dl-demos/blob/217fb01a7f2c3b15f0d7f72a00235016afbd9c4c/generative/Neural%20Style%20Transfer.ipynb), [variational autoencoders](https://github.com/rtealwitter/dl-demos/blob/217fb01a7f2c3b15f0d7f72a00235016afbd9c4c/generative/Image%20Reconstruction.ipynb), and [diffusion](https://github.com/rtealwitter/dl-demos/blob/217fb01a7f2c3b15f0d7f72a00235016afbd9c4c/generative/Diffusion.ipynb) for Chris Musco's graduate machine learning [class](https://www.chrismusco.com/machinelearning2023_grad/).

I wrote notes on 
[contrastive learning](https://www.rtealwitter.com/deeplearning2023/contrastive.html), 
[stable diffusion](https://www.rtealwitter.com/deeplearning2023/diffusion.html), and 
[implicit regularization](https://www.rtealwitter.com/deeplearning2023/regularization.html)
for the deep learning [class](https://www.rtealwitter.com/deeplearning2023/) I taught at Middlebury.

I curated code-based [demos](https://github.com/rtealwitter/dl-demos) that accompany Chinmay Hegde's graduate deep learning [class](https://chinmayhegde.github.io/dl-notes/) at NYU and my own undergraduate deep learning [class](https://www.rtealwitter.com/deeplearning2023/) at Middlebury. Recordings of the demos are available [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7H4NHNKlP-lPKJxbozO8vESzXr_YPVdm).

After struggling for years, I compiled a [how-to guide](hpc/how-to.html) for NYU's high performance computing cluster.

I am on the academic job market for Fall 2024.
