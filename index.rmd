I am a PhD candidate at NYU Tandon where I am fortunate to be advised 
by [Lisa Hellerstein](https://cse.engineering.nyu.edu/~hstein/) and [Chris Musco](https://www.chrismusco.com/). 
My research is generously supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. 
I am broadly interested in deep learning, AI for social good, and discrete optimization problems.

I received my undergraduate degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science from Middlebury College.
At Middlebury, I designed quantum algorithms for graph theory problems with [Shelby Kimmel](http://shelbykimmel.com/)
and worked on applications of math in recreational board games with [Alex Lyford](https://www.middlebury.edu/academics/math/faculty/node/550503).

After struggling with NYU's high performance computing cluster for years, I put
together a gentle introduction [here](hpc.html).
